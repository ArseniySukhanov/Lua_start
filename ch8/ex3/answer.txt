In my opinion there is a difference between minimalistic language, and absolutely light language. A lot of structures in such language could be made without using themselves, for example, "for" could be realized using "while". Howether, this make code of the language "heavier" and harder to read. But this language is made in order to optimize workflow substituting other languages in situations where you need fast and good readable code. So, in my opinion, "repeat-until" should be present.

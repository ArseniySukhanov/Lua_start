t = {sunday = "monday" ... } - it means that now we have t["sunday"]="monday"
t = { ... [sunday] = monday} - it means that now we have t[sunday] = monday => t["monday"] = monday = "sunday"
So we have t["sunday"] = "monday" and t["monday"] = "sunday"
t.sunday = t["sunday"] = "monday"
t[sunday] = t["monday"] = "sunday"
t[t.sunday] = t["monday"] = "sunday"

So the script print:
monday sunday sunday
